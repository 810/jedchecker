JEDchecker

This extension is able to check your components, modules or plugins for common errors that will prevent you
from publishing your extension on the JED.

If you want to write a rule have a look a the library/rules folder.

You just need to add a new file with your rule. Example:
yourrule.php

"yourrule.php" needs to have a class jedcheckerRulesYourrule and that class needs to have a
function that accepts the basedir as parameter. This is all - the component will automatically call
your rule check function.
